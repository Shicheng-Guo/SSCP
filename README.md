## Systemic Sclerosis Pathway (SSCP) @ Fudan University and UW-Madison



Aim: Prepare a review paper to clarify SSc pathway. SSC pathway is constructed to compared with RA, OA pathway. GWAS, DGE, DMR of SSc should be enriched in SSCP. immnue cells, skin, lung and other organs will be collected in SSCP. 

Timeline: 
* 2020/01/08: all the genes identified by Dr. Wang's lab in Fudan should be enrolled in SSCP. 
* 2020/01/07: Collected differential gene expression analysis to SSc vs control samples ([N=2754](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5394431/))
* 2020/01/06: Collected [SSc-GWAS N=27](N27-GEAS-SSc.txt) Pubmed published Systemic Sclerosis reported genes
* 2020/01/01: Collected [first batch N=460](460SSc.txt) Pubmed published Systemic Sclerosis reported genes
